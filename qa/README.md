## QA Philosophy

This QA framework implements:

1. **Shift-Left Testing**: Early integration of quality checks
2. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on high-risk trading operations
3. **Continuous Testing**: Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Test Pyramid**: Unit → Integration → E2E → Manual
5. **Quality Gates**: Automated quality checkpoints
6. **Feedback Loops**: Rapid feedback to development team

## Testing Levels

### Level 1: Unit Testing (Foundation)
- Individual component testing
- High coverage requirements (90%+)
- Fast execution (< 10 minutes)
- Run on every commit

### Level 2: Integration Testing
- Component interaction testing
- Database integration testing
- API contract testing
- Medium execution time (10-30 minutes)

### Level 3: End-to-End Testing
- Complete user workflow testing
- Browser automation with Playwright
- Critical path validation
- Longer execution time (30-60 minutes)

### Level 4: Load & Performance Testing
- System performance under load
- Scalability testing
- Stress testing
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Level 5: Security Testing
- Authentication/authorization testing
- Data validation testing
- Penetration testing scenarios
- Vulnerability scanning

## Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Code Quality (Pre-commit)
- [ ] Unit tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Code coverage ≥ 90%
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Security scan passes
- [ ] No critical vulnerabilities

### Gate 2: Integration Quality (PR Review)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] API tests pass
- [ ] Database migration tests pass
- [ ] WebSocket tests pass
- [ ] Performance regression check

### Gate 3: System Quality (Pre-deployment)
- [ ] E2E tests pass
- [ ] Load tests meet benchmarks
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Monitoring validates system health
- [ ] Rollback plan validated

### Gate 4: Production Quality (Post-deployment)
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Trading operations validated
- [ ] Performance metrics within SLA
- [ ] Error rates below threshold
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met

## Risk-Based Testing Priority

### Critical Risk (P0) - Trading Operations
- Order placement and execution
- Risk management calculations
- Account balance updates
- Position management
- Emergency stop functionality

### High Risk (P1) - Security & Data
- Authentication and authorization
- API key encryption/decryption
- Data validation and sanitization
- Session management
- Rate limiting

### Medium Risk (P2) - User Experience
- Dashboard functionality
- Real-time updates
- Chart rendering
- Navigation flows
- Error handling

### Low Risk (P3) - Supporting Features
- Logging and monitoring
- Configuration management
- Non-critical UI elements
- Documentation
- Help systems

## Continuous Testing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Developer Testing
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
1. Unit tests
2. Linting
3. Security scan
4. Coverage check
```

### Stage 2: Integration Testing
```bash
# On PR creation
1. Integration tests
2. API contract tests
3. Database tests
4. WebSocket tests
```

### Stage 3: System Testing
```bash
# On main branch
1. E2E tests
2. Load tests
3. Security tests
4. Performance benchmarks
```

### Stage 4: Deployment Testing
```bash
# Pre and post deployment
1. Smoke tests
2. Health checks
3. Trading validation
4. Monitoring validation
```

## Test Environment Strategy

### Local Development
- SQLite in-memory database
- Mock external services
- Fast feedback loop
- Individual feature testing

### Staging Environment
- PostgreSQL database
- Mock dYdX API (controlled responses)
- Full system integration
- Automated test execution

### Production-Like Environment
- Production database replica
- Real dYdX API (testnet)
- Load testing
- Security testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Quality Metrics

### Test Execution Metrics
- Test execution time trends
- Test failure rates by category
- Test coverage by component
- Test automation percentage

### Defect Metrics
- Defect detection rate by test level
- Defect escape rate to production
- Time to detect defects
- Time to resolve defects

### Performance Metrics
- API response time percentiles
- WebSocket message latency
- Database query performance
- Frontend rendering performance

### Business Metrics
- Trading accuracy rates
- Risk management effectiveness
- User satisfaction scores
- System uptime and availability

## Reporting and Feedback
